          Hello there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Andrew, a Software Engineer with experience in
          various disciplines. I've spent the last eight months working as a
          front-end developer, and I've really enjoyed it. I feel comfortable
          working with the React framework, which is my go-to for creating
          awesome web interfaces. I'm familiar working with web dev technology
          such as; React, Next.js, Typescript, Redux, Node.js, Express, and
          Tailwind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Learning and adapting are two things I love about this field, and I'm
          always eager to take on new challenges. Collaboration is important to
          meâ€”I believe in working together as a team to achieve the best
          results. With my diverse skill set and easygoing nature, I'm excited
          to contribute to the ever-evolving world of technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's connect and embark on this journey together. We'll bring ideas
          to life, create remarkable digital experiences, and make a positive
          impact along the way.
